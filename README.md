```

#### Highlights of the micro-service scaffolding project:
- Supports OpenAPI Specification V3.
- Provides out-of-the box '/health' API.
- Provides sample GET, PUT, POST request based on OpenAPI Specification V3.
- Auto generates stubs (controller & service classes) based on Open API Specification V3.
